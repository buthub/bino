The free graphics drivers shipped with recent Linux kernel + Mesa + X.org
combinations mostly work fine with Bino. Proprietary graphics drivers work too,
but are *not* required!

However, some free graphics drivers (especially older versions) still have some
limitations. Here is a list of known problems:

- Older drivers for Intel GMA and i965 graphics chips seem to cause Bino to crash.
  This has been reported for Ubuntu 10.04 and 10.10, but it seems to be fixed in
  11.04.

- Bino relies on OpenGL SRGB textures for proper scaling of video frames.
  Unfortunately some free graphics drivers (notably those for ATI cards) have
  broken support for such textures. As a result, the video appears far too bright.
  If this happens to you, you can set the environment variable
  SRGB_TEXTURES_ARE_BROKEN, and Bino will work around that problem.
